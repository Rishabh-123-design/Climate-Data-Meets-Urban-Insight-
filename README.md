# Climate-Data-Meets-Urban-Insight-
Over the past few days, I built a Power BI dashboard that captures real-time environmental trends across six Indian cities: Agra, Noida, Lucknow, Ajmer, Hyderabad, and Mumbai.

This project wasn’t just about tracking numbers — it was about uncovering what these trends actually mean for our cities.



📊 Some striking insights:

🔥 Agra recorded the highest temperature: 35.6°C, significantly hotter than Mumbai (26.2°C) or Hyderabad (30.1°C).

💨 Despite a “Good” AQI of 38, Agra’s CO level exceeded 501 ppm — indicating hidden pollution risks not captured in surface-level air quality scores.

🌧️ 100% rainfall chance predicted mid-to-late week for Agra, Noida, and Lucknow — sudden rainfall surges after dry spells could lead to localized flooding.

🌤️ UV Index hovered around 5 across cities — moderate, but concerning in high-heat conditions.

🧠 What this tells us:

High CO levels + clean AQI = underreported urban risk — especially dangerous for respiratory health.



Each city has a different challenge:

Agra battles extreme heat and invisible CO pollution

Noida and Lucknow face flash rain risk

Mumbai stays cool but highly vulnerable to flooding

These small shifts in climate data offer early warning signals for civic planners, ESG teams, and urban policy makers.



🔧 Tools Used:

Power BI | Excel | API Weather Data | Environmental Metrics | Urban Risk Modeling

This experience showed me how powerful data visualization + storytelling can be when trying to communicate risks and solutions around urban climate challenges.

📎 Attaching the dashboard and analysis deck. I’d love to hear how others are thinking about using data in solving environmental or city-level problems.
